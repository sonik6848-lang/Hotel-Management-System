# 🏨 Hotel Management System

## 📘 Overview
This project is a Hotel Management System designed to help hotel staff and management efficiently manage room bookings, guest data, services, and operations. It provides a web interface (and/or mobile if applicable) for customers and an admin dashboard for hotel staff.  
The system aims to reduce manual paperwork, streamline guest check‑in/check‑out, maintain service records and enhance the guest experience.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Guest registration, login and profile maintenance  
- Room booking, check‑in, check‑out and availability tracking  
- Service management (e.g., room service, housekeeping)  
- Admin dashboard for viewing reports: bookings, revenue, guest stays  
- Static website or web interface hosted in the cloud (e.g., using AWS S3 + CloudFront)  
- Data persistence (database) to track guests, rooms, bookings, services  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the website/interface)  
- **Backend / Database:** (specify what you used — e.g., MySQL / PostgreSQL / Firebase)  
- **Hosting / Cloud:** AWS S3, AWS CloudFront (for static website hosting and CDN)  
- **Tools:** Git, AWS CLI, browser testing / deployment pipeline  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sonik6848-lang/Hotel-Management-System.git
2. Navigate to the project folder and open the frontend files (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) in your browser OR set up the backend database and server (if applicable) with the following steps:
   Create a database and import the provided schema (if one exists).
    Update configuration (database connection strings or API endpoints) in the project.
    Deploy the static site to AWS S3 and configure AWS CloudFront for delivery (optional).
    Open the website in a browser to view and test:
    Customer side: browse rooms, make bookings.
    Admin side: log in to dashboard, view bookings, generate reports.

## 📊 Results / Output
A fully functioning web interface for hotel booking and management.
Real‑time tracking of room availability and guest check‑in/out status.
Admin reports summarizing revenue, guest stays, services used.
Static site loading quickly worldwide via AWS CloudFront (if configured).
